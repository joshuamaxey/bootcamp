//! References vs. Primitives

//?PRIMITIVES VS OBJECTS

//& FIVE PRIMITIVE TYPES (IMMUTABLE. Values cannot be changed, only reassigned)

//&"Immutable = cannot be changed in memory" - removes

//& When you re-assign the value of a string, you are just reassigning it to a new value, not actually changing its initial value.

/*
1. Boolean (true and false)
2. Null - represents the INTENTIONAL absence of value.
3. Undefined - default return value for many things in JavaScript.
4. Number - numerical values
5. String - text data enclosed in quotes
*/

//& ONE REFERENCE TYPE (MUTABLE. Values can be changed.)

/*
Object (data stored in the form of key-value pairs, unordered/without indices)
Array (also an object)
*/
