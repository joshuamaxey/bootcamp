//! Problem-Solving, OOP, and TDD

//! Remember POLYA!

//^ 1. understand the problem
//^ 2. Come up with a plan
//^ 3. Execute the plan
//^ 4. Revisit and refactor your solution

// If you're stuck on execution, revisit the plan.
// If you can't come up with a plan, make sure you understand the problem.
// If you can't understand the problem, or do but can't come up with a plan, work with your partner and come up with a great coding question

//! Great coding questions are:

//^ 1. Specific
//^ 2. Clear and concise
//^ 3. Show you put work into it

// Teamwork and communication are essential to success.

//! Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Test-Driven Development (TDD)

// OOP is a programming paradigm that promotes MODULARITY by enabling developers to divide their code into smaller, self-contained units called OBJECTS which represent soething in the real world and allow us to organize our code into modular, interchangeable components. To practice OOP, you will:

//^ build simple JavaScript terminal games.
//^ learn how to read and write tests using a comprehensive test suite
//^ Import a rendering library to display your games and interact with it vi an APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACE (API).
//^ Learn how to manage CONTEXT in JavaScript objects. This is one of the trickiest parts of the language, and familiarity with context is requird to unlock JavaScript's full potential.

//! Asking Great Coding Questions

//^ Due Diligence

//Before th 15-minute rule, make sure you do the following when you're stuck on a coding problem:

// 1. Read error messags and logs to isolate bugs.
// 2. Look up error messages
// 3. Review relevant sections of Readings
// 4. Check official documentation
// 5. Discuss with your peer(s)

// If you're still stuck after this, it's time for the 15-minute rule.

//^ The 15-Minute Rule

// The 15-minute Rule is meant to help you come up with a GREAT question in 15 minutes and involves 4 steps:

// 1. Write down evrything you DO understand about the problem.
// 2. Write down everything you DON'T understand about the problem.
// 3. Based on 1 and 2, write down a SPECIFIC question.
// 4. Clean up the question by ELIMINATING unnecessary words.

//! Summary

// Whenever you're stuck on a problem:

//^ 0. POLYA

// 1. understand the problem
// 2. Come up with a plan
// 3. Execute the plan
// 4. Revisit and refactor your solution

//^ 1. Due Diligence to develop a partial understanding of the problem.

// 1. Read error messags and logs to isolate bugs.
// 2. Look up error messages
// 3. Review relevant sections of Readings
// 4. Check official documentation
// 5. Discuss with your peer(s)

//^ 2. 15-minute rule to develoop a great coding question.

// 1. Write down evrything you DO understand about the problem.
// 2. Write down everything you DON'T understand about the problem.
// 3. Based on 1 and 2, write down a SPECIFIC question.
// 4. Clean up the question by ELIMINATING unnecessary words.

//^ 3. Teamwork and communication.

//~ Intro to Programming

//~ OBject-Oriented Programming is CRITICAL.

//~ To be successful, FOCUS on the curriculum, ENGAGE in teamwork, AVOID USING AI TO LEARN.

//~ DRY - DONT REPEAT YOURSELF

//~ SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY - Let each function/block have only ONE responsbility - use helper functions, etc.

//! Clean Maintainable Code Learning Objectives

//^ Export and Import elements of code from one file to another, including code written by others
//^ Write DRY code
//^ Utilize DRY to improve code written by another
//^ Construct Classes and FUnctions that adhere to the SIngle Responsbility Principle
//^ Identify violations of the Single Responsibility PRinciple (SRP) in code and refactor it
//^ Utilize an API to interact with functionality found in a li brary
//^ Write functiosn to abstract complex API commands into simpler-to-use tools

//! Reading Tests

// The most important things about a test are that it is READABLE and UNDERSTANDABLE
