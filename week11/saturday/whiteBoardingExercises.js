//! White Boarding Exercises

// Work together with your partner to solve these problems.

// Use the zoom whiteboard or pen and paper. Talk through the answers. Determine whether you're right.

// You don't necessarily have to draw images. You can write code or pseudocode or draw circles and arrows. Just indicate that you understand the problem and how to solve it.

//! Mirror Image Trees

// Draw an agorithm on a board that would return true if a binary tree is a mirror image of another binary tree.

//! Reverse Linked List

// Show an algorithm that will reverse a singly-linked list.

// That is, a list made of nodes between which tehre is a unidirectional association

//^ [12][-]--> [99][-]--> [37][-]--> [X]

//! The Missing Value

// Derive an algorithm that will inspect an array of numbers that contain the values between 1 and the length of the list (inclusive) and find the missing value.

arr = [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

//! Stack Min

// Design a stack that, in addition to the push() and pop() functions, has a function min() which returns the minimum element in the stack WITHOUT removing it.

// All three function push(), pop(), and min() should operate in O(1) time.

//! Test a Retractible Ballpoint Pen

// Write the test cases for testing a ballpoint pen. What would you consider to be good tests for the pen? Try to be as exhaustive as possible.

//! OOParking Lot

// Specify the classes that would be required to write software that will manage a paid parking lot.

// It should know where cars are parked

// Should be able to ID the cars

// Should know where the keys are hanging

// Should know how many cars are in the lot

// Should know what time the cars come and go

// Should know how much it costs someone when they leave the parking lot based on a given schedule:


//^            Time	     Rate per hour

//^         8pm  -  6am	      $3
//^         6am  -  noon	  $10
//^         noon -  6pm	      $8
//^         6pm  -  8pm	      $6
