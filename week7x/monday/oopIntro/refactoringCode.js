//! Refactoring Code

// Refactoring code is when you restructure or improve working code to make it more maintainable and easier to read.

// A coding problem is never finished until we've refactored it at least once.

// Working code can always be improved upon.

// That being said, the first step in refactoring is to have working code.

// "Working code" is code passes all of the specs for the implementation of that code with respect to the problem that it is solving. Efficiency is irrelevant at this stage

// After the code is working, we should review it and to see if we can make any improvements, especially when it comes to making it easier to read for other developers who may use your code.

// When refactoring, most developers do so according to a set of guidelines and principles that help them with consistency and readability.

// All developers, not just web developers, use these principles. In future lessons you will learn some of these that will be helpful no matter where you work.

//! Summary

// We have learned about the importance of refactoring code
