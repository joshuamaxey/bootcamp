//! Object-Oriented Programming Objectives

//^ These objectives capture how we will be evaluated on the assessments with respect to this material. We will learn to do the following:

    // 1.  Plan an object-oriented approach to JavaScript development using principles like encapsulation
    // 2.  Construct a JavaScript class and instantiate instances of that class
    // 3.  Compare and contrast references to objects vs. references to primitives
    // 4.  Create a reference to a class instance
    // 5.  Create a deep copy of a class instance
    // 6.  Debug errors caused by confusion of references to class instances vs copies of class instances
    // 7.  Create, identify, and use class instance methods and variables
    // 8.  Use the 'this' keyword to access and manipulate class instance methods and variables
    // 9.  Compare and contrast a function and a method
    // 10. Create, identify, and use class static methods and variables
    // 11. Apply class inheritance as appropriate
    // 12. Implement JavaScript classes that inherit from other classes
    // 13. Modify behavior of a child class using principles of polymorphism such as overriding
    // 14. Determine whether it's appropriate to override a parent method vs. write a new method for the child class
    // 15. Identify when to apply principles of object-oriented programming
