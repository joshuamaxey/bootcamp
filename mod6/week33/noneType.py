# ! The NoneType

# Python has only one value that implies the absence of a value.
none = None
print(none) # prints None

# Like boolean values, None must be typed with a capital N
True
False
None

# Behind the scenes, Python adds 'return None' to the end of any function definition that does not include a return statement.
# Additionally, if we use a return statement without a value, then None is returned
