//! What is Test-Driven Development?

// Test-Driven Development is the practice of writing tests before writing your code.

// There are three steps involved in TDD.

//! Motivations for TDD

//^ 1. Writing tests before code ensures that the code works.

    // Code written to pass specs is guaranteed to be testable
    // Code with pre-written tests is easily used and modified by other developers

//^ 2. Writing tests before code prevents us from writing excess or unnecessary code

//^ 3. TDD supports and promotes code modularity

//^ 4. Tests provide an understanding of what the code should be doing

//! The Three Steps of TDD: Red, Green, Refactor

//^ Red

    // Write the tests and confirm that they fail

//^ Green

    // Write code that passes the tests

//^ Refactor

    // Once we know that our code passes our tests, we refactor it to be more readable, maintainable, and to make sure that it conforms to DRY and the single responsiblity principle
