//! Test-Driven Development

//^ As programmers, we need to be able to do the following. These objectives capture how we will be evaluated on assessments with respect to this material:

    // 1.  Throw, catch, and create errors
    // 2.  Identify and effectively research common JavaScript error types
    // 3.  Compare and contrasit unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing
    // 4.  Create, modify, and write code to pas a suite of Mocha tests using the Chai assertion library
    // 5.  Understand and apply the Red-Green-Refactor cycle of Test-Driven Development
    // 6.  Read and understand test specs, refer to and navigate the Mocha and Chai docs when we encounter unfamiliar syntax
    // 7.  Construct good questions basedo n error messages
    // 8.  Write unit tests using the SIngle Responsibility Principle and DRY
    // 9.  Plan for appropriate test coverage (???)
    // 10. Identify and test for edge cases
    // 11. Interpret test specs to determine a project's requirements
