This repo contains all of my notes, practices, projects, and other material related to the App Academy curriculum.
Material is organized by weeks. "x" weeks are the most current. 
I recommend downloading the Colorful Comments extension in VSCode, all of my notes are organized with headings/subheadings by color.
