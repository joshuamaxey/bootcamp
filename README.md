This repo contains all of my notes, practices, projects, and other material related to the App Academy curriculum. 
It's ordered and organized by weeks. Week1 - 8 is only organized by day. Weeks 9+ are organized by day (directories) and topic (files).
If you want access, I'll happily add you as a collaborator.
If you do want to use this repo, it would be beneficial to install the Colorful Comments extension in VSCode. All of my notes and work is color-coded and organized using that extension.
