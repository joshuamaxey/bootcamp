//! Intro to OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and TDD (Test-Driven Development)

// We have learned the javaScript fundamentals.

// Now it's time to level up our skills and begin implementing more powerful processes.

//^ Our goals for this module are:

    // 1. Write clean, readable, maintainable code
    // 2. Understand and implement basics of Object-Oriented Programming
    // 3. Test and validate that our code works now and in the future
    // 4. Construct efficient, scalable data structures and algorithms
    // 5. Package and export our code for other deelopers to use
    // 6. Import code from other developers for use in our projects

//! Object-Oriented Programming and Test-Driven Development

// Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that promotes modularity by enabling developers to break down their code into smaller, self-contained units (objects).

// Objects are self-contained units of data and code that represent something in the real world and enable us to organize our code into modular, interchangeable components.

// We will also learn to manage context in JavaScript objects.

//! Keys to Success

// Keys to success here are pair programming, problem solving, and communication

//^ Remember Polya's problem-solving framework:

    // 1. Understand the problem
    // 2. Come up with a plan
    // 3. Execute the plan
    // 4. Revisit and refactor your solution

// If you're stuck on execution, revisit the plan.

// If you can't come up with a plan, make sure that you understand the problem.

// If you don't understand the problem, or you do understand but can't come up with a plan, work with your partner to come up with a great coding question.

//^ Great coding questions are:

    // 1. Specific
    // 2. Clear and concise
    // 3. Show you put work into it

// Thinking through the problem and writing out a plan will help you ask good questions.

// Clearn, readable code will help your peers, TAs, and instructors to help you quickly.

// Teamwork and communication will lead to success.
