//! Time and Space Complexity of Breadth and Depth-First Search

// Assuming you use a Set for visited and appropriate stacks and queues, the time complexity of both algorithms is O(n) where n is the number of edges in the graph.

// At worst, these traversals check each edge once in a directed graph and twice in an undirected graph.

// In the algorithm you have learned, space complexity is also simple.

// In a worst-case scenario, your stack or queue will have every node in it, giving it a space complexity of O(n) where (n) is the total number of nodes in the graph.

// The Set for keeping track of visited nodes will have a space coplexity of O(n) at the end of the traversal.
