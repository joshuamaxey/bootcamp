//! Code Performance Objectives

// 1. Identify time and space complexity of algorithms using big-O analysis
// 2. Recognize constant, linear, and polynomial complexities
// 3. Benchmark code performance using timing scripts and comparing to big-O analysis

//! Measuring Performance

// We'll begin by using timing benchmarks to measure code performance

// Then we will learn to evaluate time and space complexity using big-O analysis
