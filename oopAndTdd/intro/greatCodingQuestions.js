//! The 15-Minute Rule

// There are 5 traits of a great question and 4 steps to come up with one using the 15-minute rule

//! What Makes a Good Question?

//^ When you get stuck on a problem, always begin with due diligence:

    // 1. Read error messages and logs to isolate bugs
    // 2. Look up error messages
    // 3. Review relevant sections of readings
    // 4. Check official documentation
    // 5. Discuss with a peer

//! The 15-Minute Rule

// The 15-minute rule has two sides: 1. If you're stuck for more than 15 minutes, ask a question. 2. The 15-minute rule helps you come up with a great question in 15 minutes.

//^ These are the traits of a good coding question:

    // 1. It's specific
    // 2. It's clear and concise
    // 3. It shows you've put work into it

//^ To go from good to great, your question must also have the following characteristics:

    // 4. It can be answered by an instructor with little effort
    // 5. The answer unblocks you

// Steps 1, 2, and 3 are the key to achieving steps 4 and 5

//! Put Work into the Question

//^ The 15-minute rule involves 4 steps:

    // 1. Write down everything you DO understand about the problem
    // 2. Write down everything you DON'T understand about the problem
    // 3. based on 1 and 2, write down a specific question
    // 4. clean up your question by eliminating unnecessary words

// After due diligence (step 0), you will have a partial understanding of the problem.

// Once you identify the most significant gaps of confusion, write down a question to address them as specifically as possible.

// Finally, go back through your question and eliminate all unnecessary words.

//! Summary

// We have learned to use the 15-minute rule to come up with great coding questions that get great answers
