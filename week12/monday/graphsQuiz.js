//! Which data structure is used to determine the order of traversal for a depth-first traversal?

// Stack

//! Why do the practice problems give an example that is described as being only one possible solution? Why is there more than one right answer?

// The exact traversal taken is dependent on your specific algorithm.
// The exact traversal taken is dependent on the order of noes in the adjacency list.

//! What can happen if you fail to correctly add found nodes to the visited Set?

// Nodes can be visited more than once, resulting in an incorrect result.
// The traversal can become stuck in an infinte loop.
