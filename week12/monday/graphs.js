        // Nodes/vertices and edges
        // directed vs undirected
        // cyclic vs acyclic
        // weighted vs unweighted
// 2. Implement a graph using an adjacency list
// 3. Iplement a graph using a matrix
// 4. Traverse and Search a Graph in both Depth and Breadth-First order
// 5. Determine whether a node is reachable from another node via a traversal
// 6. Determine the shortest path between two nodes using a breadth-first search
// 7. Identify when a whiteboard problem can be solved with a graph

//! Intro to Graphs

//^ We've learned about node-and-pointer data structures including linked lists, binary search trees, and binary trees.

// These are all forms of graphs, which is the most general form of connected data structure

//^ Graphs are an abstract data type represented as a collection of nodes and edges.

// Each node represents one or more values and contains any number of edges pointing to other nodes.

// Graphs represent RELATIONSHIPS between objects.

// Since there are many types of relationships, there are many different types of graphs.

//^ Graphs make use of a lot of the computer science concepts we've learned.

// To solve graph problems, we will make use of arrays, hash tables and sets, stacks and queues, recursion, breadth and depth-first search, and more.

// Graph problems are tricky if you're shaky on any of these concepts. THey show up in advanced coding interviews.
