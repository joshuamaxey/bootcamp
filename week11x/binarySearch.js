//! Binary Search

// Binary search enables us to search an array in O(log n) time. This is better than the O(n) time complexity when we iterate through the array in order.

// Binary search is a divide-and-conquer approach.

//! Pre-Conditions for a Binary Search

//^ 1. Data must be sorted (every value to the left of a given value is less than that value, every value to the right of a given value is more than that value)

//^ 2. Data can be accessed by index in constant time (Binary search works on arrays, but not on linked lists or hash tables)
