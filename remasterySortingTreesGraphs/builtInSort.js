//! JavaScript's built-in Array.prototype.sort()

// JavaScript's built-in .sort() method sorts the elements of an array in-place, then returns the sorted array.

// The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code unit values.

// The time and space complexity of he sort cannot be guaranteed, it depends on implementation.

// The sort method takes in two arguments (a, b) and a compare function.

// If a compareFunction is provided, all non-undefined array elements are sorted according to the return value of the compare function

// All undefined elements ara sorte to the nd of th array, with no call to the compareFunction
