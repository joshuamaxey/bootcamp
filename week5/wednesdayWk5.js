//! Recursion tips

//^ There are THREE steps that define a recursive function:

//^ 1. The function CALLS itself
//^ 2 The function has an END STATE (base case)
//^ 3. The function MOVES CLOSER to the base case with each call.

//^ Also recall: There is a BASE CASE, a RECURSIVE CASE, and a RECURSIVE STEP.
