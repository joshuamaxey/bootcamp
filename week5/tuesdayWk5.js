//! The Call Stack

// The CALL STACK is a structure JavaScript uses to keep track of the evaluation of function calls. It uses the STACK data structure. IN computer science, a STACK is a general pattern of organizing a collection of items. FOr our current use of a stack, the items being organized are our function calls (which occur during the execution of our program).

// Imagine a STACK as a vertical pile that obeys the following pattern:

//* New items are PUSHED to the top of the pile
//* The only item that can be removed is the TOP of the pile. We call this POPPING the top item from the stack.



//^ Learning Objectives:

//^ 1. identify the two operations that characterize a STACK data structure

//^ 2. sketch how the CALL STACK is manipulated during the runtime of a simple program like the one provided in this lesson.
