//! Dieter Rams' 10 Principles for Good Design:

//^ 1. Innovative (featuring new methods; advanced and original)

//^ 2. Useful

//^ 3. Aesthetic (concerned with beauty or the appreciation of beauty)

//^ 4. Understandable

//^ 5. Unobtrusive (not conspicuous or attracting attention)

//^ 6. Honest

//^ 7. Long-lasting

//^ 8. Thorough down to the last detail

//^ 9. Environmentally friendly

//^ 10. Minimal (characterized by the use of simple or primary forms or structures)

//! Skeumorphic vs. Flat Design

//^ Skeumorphic Design is when digital components resemble physical components (depth, gradients, etc to make digital buttons, etc appear like real, physical buttons) (pre-2013)

//^ Flat Design exchanges the gradients and shadows of skeumorphic design for flat colors and thin, solid outlines. (2013 - now)

// The change from skeumorphic to flat design in tech over the course of the last decade is called a SUBTRACTIVE APPROACH.

//! Modern Web Design Principles

//^ White Space

// White space is the space we leave around text, images, and interactive elements in our design. White space can be used to improve the legibility and usability of our designs.

// On the other hand, too little white space results in buttons that are too close, text that is difficult to read, and messy, cluttered interfaces.

// "As a designer, Iâ€™ve always believed that whitespace is THE fundamental building block of good design. When designers talk about whitespace, they actually mean negative space, the space between elements in a composition."

//^ Advantages of Using Whitespace:

    // 1. Increased Content Legibility
    // 2. More Interaction
    // 3. Ability to highlight 'call to actions'
    // 4. A tidy site = an impressive site
    // 5. Creates balance
    // 6. Acts as a separator
