//! Dieter Rams' 10 Principles for Good Design:

//^ 1. Innovative (featuring new methods; advanced and original)

//^ 2. Useful

//^ 3. Aesthetic (concerned with beauty or the appreciation of beauty)

//^ 4. Understandable

//^ 5. Unobtrusive (not conspicuous or attracting attention)

//^ 6. Honest

//^ 7. Long-lasting

//^ 8. Thorough down to the last detail

//^ 9. Environmentally friendly

//^ 10. Minimal (characterized by the use of simple or primary forms or structures)

//& Note that writing SEMANTIC HTML means USING HTML ELEMENTS FOR THE RIGHT PURPOSE

//! Skeumorphic vs. Flat Design

//^ Skeumorphic Design is when digital components resemble physical components (depth, gradients, etc to make digital buttons, etc appear like real, physical buttons) (pre-2013)

//^ Flat Design exchanges the gradients and shadows of skeumorphic design for flat colors and thin, solid outlines. (2013 - now)

// The change from skeumorphic to flat design in tech over the course of the last decade is called a SUBTRACTIVE APPROACH.

//! White Space

// White space is the space we leave around text, images, and interactive elements in our design. White space can be used to improve the legibility and usability of our designs.

// On the other hand, too little white space results in buttons that are too close, text that is difficult to read, and messy, cluttered interfaces.

// "As a designer, Iâ€™ve always believed that whitespace is THE fundamental building block of good design. When designers talk about whitespace, they actually mean negative space, the space between elements in a composition."

//^ Advantages of Using Whitespace:

    // 1. Increased Content Legibility
    // 2. More Interaction
    // 3. Ability to highlight 'call to actions'
    // 4. A tidy site = an impressive site
    // 5. Creates balance
    // 6. Acts as a separator

//! Colors

// "Color themes are designed to be harmonious, ensure accessible text, and distinguish UI elements and surface from one another."

//^ Color Principles:

    // 1. Hierarchical: Colors indicate which elements are interactive, how they relate to other elements, and their level of prominence. Important elements should stand out the most.

    // 2. Legible: Text and important elements, like icons, should meet legibility standards when appearing on colored backgrounds.

    // 3. Expressive: Show brand colors at memorable moments that reinforce your brand's style.

//^ Aesthetics

// Colors should compliment each other, and there are tools to help you pick colors that look great:
    //* https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel (will help you customize a set of matching colors)
    //* https://material.io/design/color/the-color-system.html (guides you toward appropriate application of those colors in your project)

//^ Accessibility

// Color should be easily distinguishable, even for the color-blind (color-blindness affects 300 million people world-wide). We achieve this by ensuring that our colors are distinct in hue, saturation, and value. See the following link to see how an image looks from a color-blind perspective:

//! Typography

//^ Serif vs. Sans-Serif

// Serif Fonts have small strokes on the ends of letters for increased long-form readability on mobile or low-resolution devises. These applications are typically longer strings of words (paragraphs, etc) with smaller text sizes.
    // Georgia
    // New York
    // Roboto Slab

// Sans-Serif Fonts do NOT have those stroks, and instead are minimal and clean. These are ideal for short-form applications such as headlines, icons, and navigation. THse applications typically use shorter strings of works with larger text sizes.
    // Verdana
    // San Francisco
    // Roboto
