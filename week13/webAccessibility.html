<!-- ! What is Web Accessibility? -->

<!--
Web accessibility is the practice of implementing design decisions which make a website accessible to a variety of users.

Typically, we think of web accessibility as supporting users with disabilities.

When we design with accessibility in mind, we create a better user experience for all users.

Designing for accessibility is the law. Federal law requires that websites be designed to meet certain minimum criteria for accessibility. If webpages do not meet these standards, the owner can be sued.

The WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) are a set of standards for designing accessible web content.

If a software company does not make the effort to provide accessbile resources for users, they can be sued for violating this federal law.

    <h1><b>What is Web Accessibility?</b></h1>

    <p>Web is the practice of implementing design decisions which make a website accessible to a variety of users.

    <p>When we design with accessibility in mind, we create a better user eperience for all users.</p>
    <p>Federal law requires that websits be designed to meet certain minimum criteria for accessibility.</p>

    <h1><b>WCAG Compliance</b></h1>

    <p>The WCAG (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>) is a set of standards
        for designing accessible web content.</p>

    <h2>Four Principles</h2>

    <p>The following <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/">WCAG Quick Reference Guide</a> provides a full
        list of guidelines that will help you to meet the WCAG according to four primary principles while the <a
            href="https://www.wuhcag.com/wcag-checklist/">WCAG Checklist</a> offers a short summary of these guidelines.
    </p>

    <h3>Percievable</h3>

    <p><i>Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can percieve.</i>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 1:</b> Structure HTML such that the code reflects a hierarchy of relationships between
            elements
            which
            can be interpreted by assistive devices.</li>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 2:</b> When Color is used to convey meaning, convey that maning through other means as
            well so
            that colorblind
            users can percieve the meaning as well as those who can percieve color.</li>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 3:</b> Avoid using images of text, as these cannot be interpreted by assisstive devices
            such as
            screenreaders. Use
            text instead.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Operable</h3>

    <p><i>User interface components and navigation must be operable.</i></p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 1:</b> Users should be able to perform all operation using a keyboard, as opposed to
            relying
            solely on a mouse. This supports users with mobility limitations.</li>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 2:</b> All navigation links should be clearly labeled as to their purpose(usually through
            the
            text
            that is displayed).</li>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 3:</b> Targets (buttons, hyperlinks, etc) must be sufficiently large that they are
            user-friendly.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Understandable</h3>

    <p><i>Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.</i></p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 1:</b> The web page must specify its language and support translation for multilingual
            users.
        </li>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 2:</b> Clear error messages must be displayed to assist the user when there are errors in
            user
            input.</li>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 3:</b> Predictable navigation patterns must exist across web pages as well as clearn
            instructions
            or directions for user intraction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3></h3>

    <h3>Robust</h3>

    <p><i>Content must be sufficiently robust such that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents,
            including asestive technologies.</i></p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 1:</b> All elements have unique id attributes. This supports parsing and interpretation
            of the
            contents by assistive devices.</li>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 2:</b> All HTML syntax is correct, with appropriate nesting and opening/closing tags</li>
    </ul>
