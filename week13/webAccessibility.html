<!-- ! What is Web Accessibility? -->

<!--
Web accessibility is the practice of implementing design decisions which make a website accessible to a variety of users.

Typically, we think of web accessibility as supporting users with disabilities.

When we design with accessibility in mind, we create a better user experience for all users.

Designing for accessibility is the law. Federal law requires that websites be designed to meet certain minimum criteria for accessibility. If webpages do not meet these standards, the owner can be sued.

    <h1><b>WCAG Compliance</b></h1>

    <p>The WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) is a set of standards for designing accessible web content.</p>

    <h2>Four Principles</h2>

    <h3>Percievable</h3>

    <p><i>Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can percieve.</i></p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 1:</b> Structure HTML such that the code reflects a hierarchy of relationships between elements
            which
            can be interpreted by assistive devices</li>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 2:</b>When Color is used to convey meaning, convey that maning through other means as well so
            that colorblind
            users can percieve the meaning as well as those who can percieve color.</li>
        <li><b>Example 3:</b>Avoid using images of text, as these cannot be interpreted by assisstive devices such as
            screenreaders. Use
            text instead.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Operable</h3>

    <p><i>User interface components and navigation must be operable</i></p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 1:</b>Users should be able to perform all operation using a keyboard, as opposed to relying
            solely on a mouse. This supports users with mobility limitations.</li>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 2:</b>All navigation links should be clearly labeled as to their purpose(usually through the text
            that is displayed)</li>
        <li><b>EXAMPLE 3:</b> Targets (buttons, hyperlinks, etc) must be sufficiently large that they are user-friendly.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Understandable</h3>

    <h3>Robust</h3>
