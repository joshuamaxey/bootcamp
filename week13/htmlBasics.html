<!-- ! Three Components of HTML: Tags, Elements, and Attributes -->

<!-- ^ Tags -->

<!-- Most tags come in pairs (an opening and a closing tag)
Tags that do NOT have a closing tag are called 'empty tags' -->

<!-- ^ Elements -->

<!-- An HTML element refers to the OPENING TAG, CLOSING TAG, and the CONTENT between them. With respect to EMPTY TAGS, 'element' refers to the tag itself as well as the content within that tag. -->

<!-- ^ Attributes -->

<!-- Attributes are used to define additional information about an element.

They are located inside the OPENING TAG, and typically come in name/value pairs.

name="value" For Example:

<img src="URL"> -->

<!-- * HTML Attribute Standard Practices -->

<!-- 1. Write attributes in LOWER CASE ONLY -->
<!-- 2. Put quotation marks around the VALUE -->
<!-- 3. Use DOUBLE QUOTES, not single quotes -->

<!-- ! WhiteSpace, Tags, Attributes, and Content -->

<!-- When a browser is parsing an HTML document, it ignores whitespace including line breaks between the tag name and attributes. The whitespace that is ingored is called 'negligible whitespace'. Whitespace is converted to single spaces in the content.-->
